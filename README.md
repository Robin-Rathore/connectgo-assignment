## Pages & Components

### Home Page
The Home page serves as the main landing page for the application, featuring:
- Navigation bar with user authentication status
- Summary cards showing key metrics
- Interactive charts displaying important data
- Quick access to user and team profiles

### User Profile
The User Profile page displays comprehensive information about individual users:
- Profile image and basic information
- Activity metrics and engagement statistics
- Achievement badges and progress indicators
- Historical data visualized through charts
- Interactive elements to update profile information

Key components:
- User information card
- Activity timeline
- Achievement showcase
- Progress indicators
- Profile editing functionality

### Team Profile
The Team Profile page showcases information about teams within the application:
- Team composition and structure
- Team performance metrics
- Member contributions visualization
- Team achievements and goals

Key components:
- Team overview card
- Member list with individual contributions
- Performance charts
- Achievement timeline

### 404 Page Not Found
A custom page that appears when users navigate to non-existent routes:
- Clear "404" indication with large typography
- Simple explanation of the error
- Navigation options to return to valid pages
- Information about the application's purpose and limitations
- Consistent branding with the application's color scheme

## UI Components

### Navigation Components
- **Navbar**: Main navigation component with:
  - Logo/brand element
  - Navigation links
  - User authentication status
  - Mobile responsive menu

### Card Components
Various card components used throughout the application:
- **ProfileCard**: Displays user or team basic information
- **StatCard**: Showcases metrics and statistics
- **ActivityCard**: Shows recent activities or events
- **AchievementCard**: Displays badges and accomplishments

### Interactive Elements
- **Button**: Various button styles for different actions
- **Tabs**: For organizing content into tabbed interfaces
- **Dialog**: For modal interactions and confirmations
- **DropdownMenu**: For additional options and actions
- **Sheet**: For slide-in panels on mobile devices

### Data Visualization
- **BarChart**: For comparing values across categories
- **PieChart**: For showing proportional data
- **Progress**: For displaying completion status
- **Timeline**: For sequential events or activities

## State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management solutions:

- **useState**: For component-level state
- **useEffect**: For side effects and lifecycle management
- **useContext**: For sharing state across component trees

Example state implementation:

```jsx
const [profile, setProfile] = useState({
  name: "",
  role: "",
  avatar: "",
  stats: { /* ... */ }
});

useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch profile data
  // Update profile state
}, [profileId]);
```

## AI Integration

The project utilizes multiple AI tools for development and content generation:

### ChatGPT Integration
- Used for generating initial component structures
- Helped with styling suggestions and CSS implementations
- Assisted with state management patterns

### Claude Integration
- Created advanced UI components with complex interactions
- Generated comprehensive documentation
- Optimized component architecture and performance

### DeepSeek Integration
- Specialized assistance for data visualization components
- Helped with complex state management solutions
- Provided code optimization recommendations

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher) or yarn (v1.22.0 or higher)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Install required UI libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install @shadcn/ui lucide-react recharts
   # or
   yarn add @shadcn/ui lucide-react recharts
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Component Creation
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the component structure established in the project
- Utilize the shadcn/ui component library for consistency

### Styling Approach
- Use the established color scheme (#FF69B4, #F6339A, #FFFFFF, #FDF2F8)
- Maintain responsive design principles for all components
- Follow the existing styling patterns for consistency

### Code Standards
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Implement error handling for all async operations
- Write unit tests for critical components

### Performance Considerations
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations
- Use React.memo for components that render frequently
- Lazy load components that aren't immediately visible
- Optimize image assets for fast loading

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Enhanced user authentication and authorization
- Advanced data analytics dashboard
- Real-time notifications system
- Expanded team collaboration tools
- Mobile application with React Native

### Technical Improvements
- Server-side rendering for improved performance
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Accessibility improvements
- Internationalization support
